Ready to use vue components with the styling and behavior of material design.

## component architecture principles

* container components e.g. 'Card' have named slots to fill in other components
* sub-components e.g. 'List' for optional content in other components
* state is outside of components and will be passed in as props - maybe modeled
* components react on state changes with actions

## TODO
